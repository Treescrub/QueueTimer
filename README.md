# QueueTimer
Times total time spent in queues and lobbies in Dead by Daylight. Also counts time spent in queues and lobbies if ran after game startup.

This works by frequently checking the game log for queue start, queue cancel, lobby join, lobby leave, and game start and getting the time between the actions.


No longer works, as the log file is now encrypted.
